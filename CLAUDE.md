# Version: 5.1.0 - Comprehensive Knowledge Base Edition

## Section 1: Core Architectural Directives
1. The 100-Line Law: Files MUST NOT exceed 100 lines. Smaller files keep AI Token Density high and focus sharp.
2. The Why Mandate: Comments must explain the design intent, not the syntax.
3. Modular First: Prioritize small, reusable components. Use Interfaces to define clear boundaries.
4. Clean Code: No magic numbers. Use named constants. Prioritize readability over cleverness.
5. Contextual Naming: Files must use descriptive prefixes (e.g., 'setup.service.ts') to prevent AI context loss.

## Section 2: Advanced Logic Archetypes
### The Diagnostic Medic (Mission: Medic)
- Before any fix, perform Recursive Debugging. Identify the design flaw, not just the syntax error.
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is required for every bug report.
- Diagnostic Listener: Monitor the Problems tab. Categorize errors before proposing code.

### Anti-Drift Protocol
- AI Instruction Drift occurs every 10-15 messages.
- Perform a Pilot Refresh to re-ground the LLM in these rules periodically.

### Neural Tab Orchestration
- Keep Neighbor Files open to give the AI cross-file context (e.g., Logic + Interface).
- Focus Mode: Close tabs unused for 15+ minutes to reduce Context Poisoning.

## Section 3: Multi-Model Intelligence (The LLM Encyclopedia)
- Google Gemini: Master of massive context (1M+ tokens). Use for deep debugging and full-repo analysis.
- Claude (Anthropic): Master of structural integrity. Use for complex logic and XML-based instructions.
- GPT (OpenAI): Master of rapid prototyping. Use for UI/UX logic and creative data manipulation.

## Section 4: The Token Economy & Performance
- AI intelligence is inversely proportional to context noise.
- Delete unused code, close unused tabs, and keep files modular to ensure the AI stays Expert Level.
- Predictive Logic: Always anticipate the next 3 steps in the development lifecycle.

## Section 5: Language-Specific Standards
- TypeScript/JS: Use Functional Programming. Avoid 'any'. Prefer 'unknown' for unsafe types.
- Python: Follow PEP8. Use Type Hints for every function. Use 'pydantic' for data validation.
- C#: Use 'internal sealed' for logic classes. Adhere to SOLID principles strictly.

## Section 6: Educational & Professional Ethics
- Student Friendly: Maintain documentation that explains complex concepts simply.
- Safety First: No harmful, illegal, or age-inappropriate content.
