#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is managed by the consumed project. For a device or application, you might want to
#   check these files in.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in BC.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if the platform is not identical, the lock file will
#   prevent install, so you may want to handle this manually.

#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in BC.
